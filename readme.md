  Siste y medio
  	
  This program is a card game called "siete y medio", where user can start by playing the single version of it.

  Goal: Player can beat the dealer by getting cards add up as close to 7 and a half as possible. If the sum is over than 7.5 would be considered as "busting". 
  	Player loses the game whenver a busting happens.


  The game keeps going on until the player lose all the money or the dealer lose 900. After each game, players get or lose the bet accordingly. And the hands of players get reset as desired.
  
  For implementation, I added print_card and show_all, these two member function addtionally to help organizing the code so that the main function looks neat.
